 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>Nothing makes you feel like a professional chef quite like nailing the perfect fried egg in your very own kitchen. No matter if it’s topping a toasty buttered bagel or sliding onto a crispy potato hash, a smooth, golden yolk isn’t just delicious, it’s also the epitome of aesthetic cooking.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the runny, fried egg moment you picture in your head never actually makes it to the plate. Between the transfer and the handling, that fragile yolk can burst and start cooking right in your hot pan—and that, my friends, can put a major damper on your morning toast.</p>
